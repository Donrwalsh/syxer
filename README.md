## Train of Thought / Working Notes

#### 2/21/25

I will need code that writes to a spreadsheet. Google Script is how I will do this since it is native to the spreadsheet program being used. I don't remember how to work with Google Scripts in the slightest. Looks like you just use **Extensions** > **Apps Script** to get to the interface.

[This](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uVEARqNbGgES_16-PmFe5Fq25sSj9fkmWusW5EUdvr0/edit?gid=1534554294#gid=1534554294) is the ultimate destination sheet but I'll work with a [copy](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lze7Z7bbPDIQRUaCagSQWXESewI7kqVfgQa5nitPRFM/edit?gid=1623859890#gid=1623859890) for now.

And here we are at the Google Apps Script (gas) interface. I'll need to remind myself how to use this interface. Let's think about what this interface needs to facilitate:

- obtain correct data
- determine where that data goes on the spreadsheet
- write data into a specified spreadsheet cell
- repeat periodically

#### 2/22/25

I'm eating breakfast and looking at the mapping from Gannon's stats to the spreadsheet. C1R/C2R sound complicated so I won't mess with those for now. Populating the Strokes section looks straightforward and note that I'll only be touching the D column Result data - Points and total are calculated but aren't shaded a different color so keep that in mind. The structure of this top bit is built based on ease of data entry so also consider it possible to change and such.

Anyway, I want to start with writing data into a specified spreadsheet cell, that seems the most basic of the 4 tasks I need GAS to accomplish.

So I find [Read & write cell values](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/guides/values) but I remember I don't really know how to use GAS in the first place, so I go to [Google Apps Script: A Beginnerâ€™s Guide](https://www.benlcollins.com/apps-script/google-apps-script-beginner-guide/). I have some hello world text and I need to save the project to drive before the run button is clickable. It needs a name too so I name it `Syxer Script`. I need to give permissions in order for it to run, pretty slick.

Ok, so weirdly enough the tutorial isn't producing expected results. I'm running the script but I see no evidence of the `Browser.msgBox('Hello World!');` command being interpreted correctly. Ok... I had opened these tabs yesterday so on a hunch I re-opened the GAS interface through the Sheets that it's associated with and then all of a sudden the textbox is popping up on script run. Good to know that tabs remaining open overnight may sever some important connection between script and host sheet.

Great now let's write into cell values. Gannon had one double bogey so let's write that into cell D4. The docs are helpful but I'm in more of a flyover mood so I look to this [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleAppsScript/comments/16wcdth/trying_to_write_data_to_a_google_sheet_cell_using/) instead. So here's my first attempt:

```
function myFunction() {
  var ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();
  var sheet = ss.getSheetByName('MPO #3')

  var range = sheet.getRange("D4");
  range.setValues(1);
}
```

This doesn't work because of a range mismatch on the setValues bit. I do some sleuthing. It's looking for a particular data structure here but this isn't being clearly called out anywhere. I try a couple of things and over time I just kinda keep adding characters to the setValues param haha. The progression of the line is something like this:

`range.setValues(1);`

`range.setValues('1');`

`range.setValues(['1']);`

`range.setValues([['1']]);`

It works on the last one and that makes sense: Sheets deals in 2-dimensional data so that's what the identity (so-to-speak) looks like in that system. Anyway this piece of code works and updates the spreadsheet accordingly. I'm going to make a custom function that performs all the Gannon updates explicitly, I call it `updateAllGannonStrokesExplicitly()` and it works like a charm. That's 1/4 of the tasks ready to go.

Looks like the code-file that I'm working with in the GAS interface uses a `.gs` file type. I'm going to save a snippet of this code in the repo and work on doing a commit as well since this is a reasonable milestone in the process. Making a commit through VsCode hit an authentication snag. I tried to push again and now it's timing out, oh brother. Ok that was simple to sort out. I just was missing the UAC popup that was going all the way to the other side of the screen on me. Ok but now after restarting vsCode it's giving me type-ahead-completion-suggestion stuff for while I'm typing in this README file and I do not like it. Meh, I'll fix that later.

Let's work on getting the data. Type-ahead stuff went away on it's own lol. First things first I want to be able to quickly clear out Gannon's data, so actually let's look at some structural stuff for a moment here. I'm going to use it like this:

```
function main() {
  updateAllGannonStrokesExplicitly()
}


function updateAllGannonStrokesExplicitly() {
  ...
```

So the scripts that are in the `GAS` folder (current name, I might change it around) are all available to the same script and so I can explain ordering of how I run them here and then the functions that are available within the GAS script are reproduced and referencable in the repo. Seems legit. Ok so the Interface I'll need for the next task involves a couple of functions:

- `updateGannonStats()`
- `resetGannonStats()`
- `obtainGannonData()`

I'll go in order. `updateGannonStats()` is just an enhanced version of `updateAllGannonStrokesExplicitly()` that I just created but it expands to include the STATS and MAKES sections. Those sections work the same: D column gets updated and then E columns are calc'd based off the data. I have the opportunity here to transcribe some data out of the spreadsheet and into the GAS that I'm creating so I'll do that now. One thing: I'll name this function `updateGannonStatsExplicitly()` because the explicit portion is still important seeing as I'm not exactly sure how I'll pipe data from part 3 to part 1 and such.

Note that alt-shift-F works in the GAS interface, nice. Ok, so I built a pretty version of the explicit stat writer. Now each of the cells is called out and I can work with them just through the GAS interface in some ways. Next I'm going to make the `resetGannonStats()` function which is the same as the last one but just zeroes out all the fields. I don't know enough about the data pipeline and such to know how I might make a single function that performs both these tasks so I'll just copy the last one and manually change the values. Time to turn on some music! That was easy and works like a charm. Gonna save both these functions to the repo and commit them.

(Do Ctrl+K then Ctrl+Shift+S to save without formatting because VsCode hates the pretty comment title marker things that I'm using. It's called style, look it up)

And now the main event: `obtainGannonData()`. So I need to get to the website that's in this image... Ok, brief side quest to handle images in readmes since I want to be able to do that.
