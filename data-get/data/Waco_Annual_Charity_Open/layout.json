Other OB areas (including water) are primarily defined by a white painted line or white fabric strap/rope. Where present, white OB stakes may be used as a visual aid.  As is standard, the line itself is considered OB. (806.02) \r\nOB WATER: For any area of water designated as OB that is not marked with a painted line or rope, a disc coming to rest surrounded by water is considered OB. (This does NOT apply to discs coming to rest surrounded by water within a designated RELIEF AREA or noted as casual.)\r\nCASUAL WATER: Players may obtain relief from unmarked casual areas of standing water per PDGA Rule 806.03.\r\nAD WALLS: On hole 1 ONLY, the ad wall serves as the OB line.  On ALL OTHER HOLES, ad walls that are parallel to an OB line DO NOT serve as the OB line. The OB line will be defined by a painted line or rope running in front of and parallel to the walls. The minimum distance between the walls and OB line is 1 meter.\r\nMANDATORY ROUTES: Mandatory Routes are played according to PDGA Rule 804.01. An arrow will be affixed to an object defining the left, right, or bottom boundary of the restricted plane by pointing to the side of the object opposite the restricted plane— that is, the arrow indicates the side of the object where the disc is permitted to fly. The restricted plane continues away from the marked object, as indicated by an orange painted line, and continues in the same direction of the line to infinity. Likewise, the restricted plane extends vertically from the painted line to infinity. If part of a thrown disc clearly enters into a restricted plane in play for the hole, the player receives one penalty throw. The lie for the next throw is restricted to the DROP ZONE for that MANDATORY, unless otherwise specified.  In any case where a DZ for a given Mandatory is more than 10 m from the Mandatory Object, or if the next lie after missing the Mandatory is restricted to a location other than a DZ, it will be noted and a PDGA rules waiver has been obtained.\r\nRELIEF FROM OBSTACLES: Players may obtain relief backward on the line of play, without penalty, from temporarily placed advertising assets, permanent sign posts, fairway markers, gopher holes, golf course utility boxes (green plastic fixtures), per PDGA Rule 803.02 (A). As the rule states, ‘’unless greater relief is announced by the Director’’ instead of only taking the closest lie that provides relief, the Tournament Director has granted up to 1 m relief from the aforementioned assets/obstacles.\r\nCASUAL OBSTACLES: Per rule 803.01 (B) (1), “A casual obstacle is … any item as designated by the Director,” spectator stakes and ropes that are in-bounds have been designated as casual obstacles, and may be moved and replaced ONLY if they impede a player’s stance.\r\nPLAYER GUESTS: Per PDGA waiver, players are responsible for friends or family who are spectators and who attempt to join the playing group in violation of CM 3.05.G. Players will receive courtesy violation penalties under 812.C if this occurs.\r\nTIEBREAK PROCEDURE:  In the event of a tie for first place after the scheduled rounds of play, a winner will be determined by a sudden death playoff on holes 15, 16, 17, and 18 repeating until a winner is determined.",

    "notes": "2-METER RULE:  The 2-meter rule is not in effect.\r\nCOURSE MARKINGS:  Areas of the course will be marked in colored paint as follows:  OB lines will be marked in WHITE paint;  HAZARD lines will be YELLOW;  MANDATORY LINES and DROP ZONES will be marked in ORANGE;  Defined CASUAL areas will be marked in RED;  RELIEF AREAS will be marked in PINK;  Areas designated to be of SAFETY concern will be marked in BRIGHT BLUE.\r\nOUT OF BOUNDS: Any concrete/asphalt/stone connected to or attached to OB sidewalk, road, fence, parking lot, boat ramp, or gazebo is also OB. Other OB areas (including water) are primarily defined by a white painted line or white fabric strap/rope. Where present, white OB stakes may be used as a visual aid.  As is standard, the line itself is considered OB. (806.02) \r\nOB WATER: For any area of water designated as OB that is not marked with a painted line or rope, a disc coming to rest surrounded by water is considered OB. (This does NOT apply to discs coming to rest surrounded by water within a designated RELIEF AREA or noted as casual.)\r\nCASUAL WATER: Players may obtain relief from unmarked casual areas of standing water per PDGA Rule 806.03.\r\nAD WALLS: On hole 1 ONLY, the ad wall serves as the OB line.  On ALL OTHER HOLES, ad walls that are parallel to an OB line DO NOT serve as the OB line. The OB line will be defined by a painted line or rope running in front of and parallel to the walls. The minimum distance between the walls and OB line is 1 meter.\r\nMANDATORY ROUTES: Mandatory Routes are played according to PDGA Rule 804.01. An arrow will be affixed to an object defining the left, right, or bottom boundary of the restricted plane by pointing to the side of the object opposite the restricted plane— that is, the arrow indicates the side of the object where the disc is permitted to fly. The restricted plane continues away from the marked object, as indicated by an orange painted line, and continues in the same direction of the line to infinity. Likewise, the restricted plane extends vertically from the painted line to infinity. If part of a thrown disc clearly enters into a restricted plane in play for the hole, the player receives one penalty throw. The lie for the next throw is restricted to the DROP ZONE for that MANDATORY, unless otherwise specified.  In any case where a DZ for a given Mandatory is more than 10 m from the Mandatory Object, or if the next lie after missing the Mandatory is restricted to a location other than a DZ, it will be noted and a PDGA rules waiver has been obtained.\r\nRELIEF FROM OBSTACLES: Players may obtain relief backward on the line of play, without penalty, from temporarily placed advertising assets, permanent sign posts, fairway markers, gopher holes, golf course utility boxes (green plastic fixtures), per PDGA Rule 803.02 (A). As the rule states, ‘’unless greater relief is announced by the Director’’ instead of only taking the closest lie that provides relief, the Tournament Director has granted up to 1 m relief from the aforementioned assets/obstacles.\r\nCASUAL OBSTACLES: Per rule 803.01 (B) (1), “A casual obstacle is … any item as designated by the Director,” spectator stakes and ropes that are in-bounds have been designated as casual obstacles, and may be moved and replaced ONLY if they impede a player’s stance.\r\nPLAYER GUESTS: Per PDGA waiver, players are responsible for friends or family who are spectators and who attempt to join the playing group in violation of CM 3.05.G. Players will receive courtesy violation penalties under 812.C if this occurs.\r\nTIEBREAK PROCEDURE:  In the event of a tie for first place after the scheduled rounds of play, a winner will be determined by a sudden death playoff on holes 15, 16, 17, and 18 repeating until a winner is determined.",

Other OB areas (including water) are primarily defined by a white painted line or white fabric strap/rope. Where present, white OB stakes may be used as a visual aid.  As is standard, the line itself is considered OB. (806.02) \r\nOB WATER: For any area of water designated as OB that is not marked with a painted line or rope, a disc coming to rest surrounded by water is considered OB. (This does NOT apply to discs coming to rest surrounded by water within a designated RELIEF AREA or noted as casual.)\r\nCASUAL WATER: Players may obtain relief from unmarked casual areas of standing water per PDGA Rule 806.03.\r\nAD WALLS: On hole 1 ONLY, the ad wall serves as the OB line.  On ALL OTHER HOLES, ad walls that are parallel to an OB line DO NOT serve as the OB line. The OB line will be defined by a painted line or rope running in front of and parallel to the walls. The minimum distance between the walls and OB line is 1 meter.\r\nMANDATORY ROUTES: Mandatory Routes are played according to PDGA Rule 804.01. An arrow will be affixed to an object defining the left, right, or bottom boundary of the restricted plane by pointing to the side of the object opposite the restricted plane— that is, the arrow indicates the side of the object where the disc is permitted to fly. The restricted plane continues away from the marked object, as indicated by an orange painted line, and continues in the same direction of the line to infinity. Likewise, the restricted plane extends vertically from the painted line to infinity. If part of a thrown disc clearly enters into a restricted plane in play for the hole, the player receives one penalty throw. The lie for the next throw is restricted to the DROP ZONE for that MANDATORY, unless otherwise specified.  In any case where a DZ for a given Mandatory is more than 10 m from the Mandatory Object, or if the next lie after missing the Mandatory is restricted to a location other than a DZ, it will be noted and a PDGA rules waiver has been obtained.\r\nRELIEF FROM OBSTACLES: Players may obtain relief backward on the line of play, without penalty, from temporarily placed advertising assets, permanent sign posts, fairway markers, gopher holes, golf course utility boxes (green plastic fixtures), per PDGA Rule 803.02 (A). As the rule states, ‘’unless greater relief is announced by the Director’’ instead of only taking the closest lie that provides relief, the Tournament Director has granted up to 1 m relief from the aforementioned assets/obstacles.\r\nCASUAL OBSTACLES: Per rule 803.01 (B) (1), “A casual obstacle is … any item as designated by the Director,” spectator stakes and ropes that are in-bounds have been designated as casual obstacles, and may be moved and replaced ONLY if they impede a player’s stance.\r\nPLAYER GUESTS: Per PDGA waiver, players are responsible for friends or family who are spectators and who attempt to join the playing group in violation of CM 3.05.G. Players will receive courtesy violation penalties under 812.C if this occurs.\r\nTIEBREAK PROCEDURE:  In the event of a tie for first place after the scheduled rounds of play, a winner will be determined by a sudden death playoff on holes 15, 16, 17, and 18 repeating until a winner is determined.",

Other OB areas (including water) are primarily defined by a white painted line or white fabric strap/rope. Where present, white OB stakes may be used as a visual aid.  As is standard, the line itself is considered OB. (806.02) \r\nOB WATER: For any area of water designated as OB that is not marked with a painted line or rope, a disc coming to rest surrounded by water is considered OB. (This does NOT apply to discs coming to rest surrounded by water within a designated RELIEF AREA or noted as casual.)\r\nCASUAL WATER: Players may obtain relief from unmarked casual areas of standing water per PDGA Rule 806.03.\r\nAD WALLS: On hole 1 ONLY, the ad wall serves as the OB line.  On ALL OTHER HOLES, ad walls that are parallel to an OB line DO NOT serve as the OB line. The OB line will be defined by a painted line or rope running in front of and parallel to the walls. The minimum distance between the walls and OB line is 1 meter.\r\nMANDATORY ROUTES: Mandatory Routes are played according to PDGA Rule 804.01. An arrow will be affixed to an object defining the left, right, or bottom boundary of the restricted plane by pointing to the side of the object opposite the restricted plane— that is, the arrow indicates the side of the object where the disc is permitted to fly. The restricted plane continues away from the marked object, as indicated by an orange painted line, and continues in the same direction of the line to infinity. Likewise, the restricted plane extends vertically from the painted line to infinity. If part of a thrown disc clearly enters into a restricted plane in play for the hole, the player receives one penalty throw. The lie for the next throw is restricted to the DROP ZONE for that MANDATORY, unless otherwise specified.  In any case where a DZ for a given Mandatory is more than 10 m from the Mandatory Object, or if the next lie after missing the Mandatory is restricted to a location other than a DZ, it will be noted and a PDGA rules waiver has been obtained.\r\nRELIEF FROM OBSTACLES: Players may obtain relief backward on the line of play, without penalty, from temporarily placed advertising assets, permanent sign posts, fairway markers, gopher holes, golf course utility boxes (green plastic fixtures), per PDGA Rule 803.02 (A). As the rule states, ‘’unless greater relief is announced by the Director’’ instead of only taking the closest lie that provides relief, the Tournament Director has granted up to 1 m relief from the aforementioned assets/obstacles.\r\nCASUAL OBSTACLES: Per rule 803.01 (B) (1), “A casual obstacle is … any item as designated by the Director,” spectator stakes and ropes that are in-bounds have been designated as casual obstacles, and may be moved and replaced ONLY if they impede a player’s stance.\r\nPLAYER GUESTS: Per PDGA waiver, players are responsible for friends or family who are spectators and who attempt to join the playing group in violation of CM 3.05.G. Players will receive courtesy violation penalties under 812.C if this occurs.\r\nTIEBREAK PROCEDURE:  In the event of a tie for first place after the scheduled rounds of play, a winner will be determined by a sudden death playoff on holes 15, 16, 17, and 18 repeating until a winner is determined.",
